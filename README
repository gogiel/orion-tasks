Google Task Orion plugin made at Hackathon in 10 hours.

At first use user has to authenticate using tasks.html
Code is buggy and messy (callback hell, non-objective, copy-pastes), because it was meant to work ASAP.
Most of the time (about 3-4 hours) we spent struggling with authenticating at Google and it still needs some repair. Currently every request is wrapped in authenticate and api.load callbacks so it's very uneffective, but at least worked.
We also found bug in Google Tasks API - update action doesn't work and always returns 400.

Our thoughts:
* Orion API callbacks should be provided with more data. We made dirty hack and used window.parent object to obtain file name from breadcrumb
* It's unclear when iframe with plugin actually loads
* very small plugin API. For example it's not possible to make a command (button) that always works on whole file
* there's no way (or it's not documeneted) how to postopone returning of API command
* there's no way to block editor (to wait for API call success)
* there's no way to create own page without hacking orion.core and copying files
* there's no standard way of plugins/editor communication (we wanted to trigger event to refresh outline)
